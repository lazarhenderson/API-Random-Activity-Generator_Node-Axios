# Local Server API Requests with Node and Axios

This project demonstrates making API requests from a local server using Node.js and Axios. It includes both a frontend and a backend, and does not require an API key to run.

## Technologies Used

1. **Express:** Framework for creating the web server and defining routes.
2. **Body-Parser:** Middleware to parse URL-encoded request bodies.
3. **Axios:** HTTP client for making API requests.
4. **EJS & CSS:** Templating engine for rendering views and basic frontend styling.
5. **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for executing server-side code.

## How to Run

Ensure Node.js is installed on your PC. Then follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Install the required NPM packages:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the code:

   ```bash
   node index.js
   ```

4. Open your web browser (Google Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Opera) and navigate to:

   ```http
   https://localhost:3000/
   ```
